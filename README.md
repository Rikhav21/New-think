# Rock Paper Scissors Shoot!
# How it works
THis is a python script that I am hosting on nest that uses mediapip eto capture the location of your hands, and add classify them using a model which I trained using c.py. All the data is stored and classified in the data folder, and if you want to callect more, you can collect it by running c.py, and if you want to run it locally, you can do so py running app.py. Right now it is running at  https://rpss.rmardia.hackclub.app/.
